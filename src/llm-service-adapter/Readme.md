# LLM Service Adapter Framework

## 1. Introduction

The LLM Service Adapter Framework is a versatile and customizable solution designed to simplify the integration of various AI-driven chat applications with multiple platforms, such as Discord, Slack, and FastAPI. By providing a unified approach to managing different chat services and adapters, this framework enables rapid development and deployment of chatbots across different platforms with ease.

## 2. Importance and Utility

Building AI-powered chatbots that can cater to different platforms is a challenging task, as each platform has its unique requirements and specifications. The LLM Service Adapter Framework simplifies this process by providing a modular and extensible architecture that seamlessly integrates with various chat services and platforms.

This framework is essential because it:

- Reduces the effort required to develop and maintain chatbot applications for different platforms.
- Streamlines the development process by abstracting platform-specific complexities.
- Encourages code reuse and modularity by separating the chat service logic from platform-specific adapters.

## 3. When to Use

Use the LLM Service Adapter Framework when:

- Developing AI-powered chatbots that need to work across multiple platforms.
- Looking for a modular and extensible architecture to simplify chatbot development and maintenance.
- Needing a flexible solution that can be easily extended to support custom chat services and platforms.

## 4. Benefits

### 4.1. Modular Architecture

The framework employs a modular architecture that separates chat service logic from platform-specific adapters, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

### 4.2. Customizable

The framework allows for easy customization and extension of both chat services and adapters, enabling developers to integrate their own AI-driven chat applications or support additional platforms.

### 4.3. Streamlined Development

By abstracting platform-specific complexities, the framework allows developers to focus on building high-quality AI-driven chat applications without worrying about the intricacies of each platform.

### 4.4. Scalable

The framework is designed to support a growing number of chat services and platforms, allowing for easy expansion as needed.

## 5. Installation and Usage

To install and use the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set the necessary environment variables, such as API keys and tokens.
4. Run the main.py script with the desired arguments, e.g., `python main.py --service wandbot --app discord`.

## 6. Example Flow

```python
# main.py
from adapters.fastapi.app import create_app
from managers import ServiceManager, AdapterManager
import uvicorn

# Initialize the service manager and get a LLM service (e.g., wandbot)
service_manager = ServiceManager()
llm_service = service_manager.get_llm_service("wandbot")
db_service = service_manager.get_db_service()

# Initialize the adapter manager and get an adapter (e.g., fastapi)
adapter_manager = AdapterManager()
adapter = adapter_manager.get_adapter("fastapi", llm_service, db_service)

# Run the FastAPI app
app = create_app(adapter)
uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

```

1. Create a new AI-driven chat service by extending the base class and implementing the required methods.
2. Develop a custom adapter to integrate the chat service with a specific platform.
3. Register the new chat service and adapter in the appropriate managers.
4. Run the main.py script, specifying the desired chat service and platform adapter.

## 7. Building a Custom LLM Service

To build a custom LLM service:

```python
# custom_llm_service.py
from .chat import Chat
import openai
import os

openai.api_key = os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")

class CustomLLMService:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "gpt-4"):
        self.chat = Chat(model_name=model_name)

    def chat(self, query: str):
        return self.chat(query)

# Register the custom service in the service manager
from managers import ServiceManager
service_manager = ServiceManager()
service_manager.register_llm_service("custom", CustomLLMService)
```

1. Create a new class that extends the base LLMService class.
2. Implement the required methods, such as `chat` and `init_wandb`.
3. Register the new service in the ServiceManager by adding an entry in the `get_llm_service` method.

## 8. Building a Custom Adapter

```python
# custom_adapter.py
class CustomAdapter:
    def __init__(self, llm_service, db_service):
        self.llm_service = llm_service
        self.db_service = db_service

    def process_message(self, message: str):
        # Preprocess the message (e.g., clean text, extract metadata)
        preprocessed_message = self.preprocess_message(message)

        # Call the LLM service to generate a response
        response = self.llm_service.chat(preprocessed_message)

        # Postprocess the response (e.g., format the response, add custom elements)
        postprocessed_response = self.postprocess_response(response)

        return postprocessed_response

    def preprocess_message(self, message: str):
        # Add preprocessing logic here
        return message

    def postprocess_response(self, response: str):
        # Add postprocessing logic here
        return response

# Register the custom adapter in the adapter manager
from managers import AdapterManager
adapter_manager = AdapterManager()
adapter_manager.register_adapter("custom", CustomAdapter)
```

To build a custom adapter:

1. Create a new class that extends the base Adapter class.
2. Implement the required methods, such as `send_message` and `process_event`.
3. Register the new adapter in the AdapterManager by adding an entry in the `get_adapter` method.

## 9. Building an App for Your Custom Adapter

Now that you have created a custom adapter, you'll want to build a custom app that can communicate with the adapter and utilize the framework. In this section, we'll guide you through the process of building a custom app for your adapter.

### Understanding the Custom App Requirements

Your custom app should be designed to interact with the adapter you've created. It must be able to:

1. Initialize the adapter with the LLM service and DB service.
2. Handle user input and pass it to the adapter.
3. Display the adapter's responses to the user.

### Steps to Create a Custom App

1. **Import required modules and classes**: Import your custom adapter, the LLM service, and the DB service in your custom app.

```python
from managers import ServiceManager, AdapterManager
from my_custom_adapter import CustomAdapter
```

2. **Initialize the services and adapter**: Initialize the LLM service, DB service, and your custom adapter. You can use the `ServiceManager` and `AdapterManager` classes for this purpose.

```python
service_manager = ServiceManager()
llm_service = service_manager.get_llm_service("custom")
db_service = service_manager.get_db_service()

adapter_manager = AdapterManager()
adapter_manager.register_adapter("custom", CustomAdapter)
adapter = adapter_manager.get_adapter("custom", llm_service, db_service)
```

3. **Handle user input**: Create a function or method to handle user input. This function should take the input from the user, process it if necessary, and pass it to the adapter's `handle_message` method.

```python
def process_user_input(user_input):
    response = adapter.handle_message(user_input)
    return response
```

4. **Display the response**: Once you have the response from the adapter, display it to the user in a suitable format.

```python
def display_response(response):
    # Format and display the response to the user
    print(response)
```

5. **Implement the main loop**: Finally, implement the main loop of your custom app to continuously receive input from the user, process it using your adapter, and display the response.

```python
def main():
    while True:
        user_input = input("Enter your message: ")
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            break
        response = process_user_input(user_input)
        display_response(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

By following these steps, you'll be able to build a custom app that can interact with your custom adapter and utilize the framework to its full potential.
